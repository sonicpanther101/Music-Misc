# Miscilaneous Music parsing tools

## Rules my music must follow

- All in `New unformated songs` folder while being processed
- All Flacs
- No Asterixs in lyrics (no need for censorship on locally hosted music)
- Translated copy of the lyrics in brackets at the same timestamp
- Lyrics on the `LYRICS` tag for phone app (might struggle on foobar openlyrics)
- All files need to have artist, `title`, `album`, `date` and `album artist` tags
- If multiple artists, split by `;`
- If album artist is missing, it can be the artist, if multiple artists, then the one who produced the album
- Date needs to just be the year of release
- Album version is only to be mentioned in album tag and no other
- If there is a special version of a song on an album, then it can be mentioned in the title (live or remixed for example)
- File title is to be `title - artist` and if it isn't a single, ` - album`
- All in `My Playlist` folder
- All tags normalised (if there are different ways to have the tag text like `joan jet & the  blasckhearts` vs `joan jet and the blasckhearts`)
- All files have artist image chosen by me
- All images normalised (to get rid of files with same image different size and so on)
- All images in the order of album then artist for namida
- There should only ever be 2 images on each song file
- All songs should be at 16 bit 44.1kHz and no less unless no better version is available (should be checked thoroughly)
