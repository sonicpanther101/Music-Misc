lyrics_fetcher.py - fill in time-synced lyrics automatically before you'd
ever need to open Foobar/MusicBee/a browser and do it by hand.

Order of attempts, per track:
  1. LRCLIB (https://lrclib.net) - exact match by artist/title/album/duration,
     falling back to a fuzzy search. LRCLIB also tells us directly when a
     track is instrumental.
  2. NetEase Cloud Music - search by artist/title, pull the LRC lyric for
     the best match. NetEase marks instrumentals with the standard
     "纯音乐，请欣赏" ("instrumental, please enjoy") line instead of a flag,
     so we detect that text.
  3. If neither has a *synced* version: if either had *plain* (unsynced)
     text, that's saved as a stopgap so you only have to add timestamps
     while listening, not type the words out - and the file is reported
     as needing a manual sync pass (see lyrics_checker.py).
  4. If nothing at all was found, the file is reported as needing lyrics
     entirely.

A failure in one source (a network hiccup, or an unofficial API like
NetEase's answering with something other than the JSON shape we expect)
does not cost you the other source: each is tried independently, and only
shows up as "error" in the summary if BOTH failed AND nothing was found
either way - at which point the message says which source(s) failed and
why, rather than a bare Python exception with no context.

Writes into the vorbis-comment fields foo_openlyrics reads:
  - lyrics: the LRC text (or blank, for instrumentals)
  - instrumental: "1" for tracks with no vocals

Existing lyrics are left untouched by default (pass overwrite=True to
re-fetch anyway), except that a plain/unsynced lyrics tag will still be
upgraded automatically if a synced version turns up, since replacing an
unsynced tag with a synced one is always a strict improvement.
